4. Using the sample phrases you generated in your table \(if necessary\) alter the "flow," wherein the bot, after conversing with a user, shares those phrases. 
5. Work on your user flow until you have a complete user experience \(meaning that the user can fully accomplish their instrumental goals--learn about a video game, book an appointment, et cetera\). 
6. Remember that your converstaional flow should emerge from the work you've done in your planning tables. 
7. After you have a complete user flow finished, go to the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) book you made for your previous assignments.
