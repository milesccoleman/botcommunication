# Week 4: Message Scripting

## Making Compelling Scripts

Social [scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_theory) are an oft-used concept regarding human behavior and social interaction. Psychology, communication studies, performance studies \(e.g., theatre\), English, philosophy--many social scientific and humanities based disciplines talk about the scripts we follow in day to day life. In this week's module, we'll be examining some ways to _script_ the kinds of communication that our bots will follow when making messages. 



### The Scripts of Everday Interactions

Often when we're talking about scripts, we are talking about special occasions, or even highly dramatized or "fake" interactions. Scripts are the things that movies and stage plays are based on, in other words. However, the way that we will talk about scripts has to do with everyday communication, and genuine communication, based on sequences of messaging that we have learned \(culturally\) to expect. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Social scripts** are the behaviors, actions, and outcomes that are expected from particular contexts. The social script that one follows when meeting a professional colleague for the first time is different from the social script of how to console a close friend or to make a joke with your significant other. 

_Note: Social scripts, because they are "second nature" are often invisible until our expectations are not met._ 
{% endhint %}

As an example, let's look at a common scrip we're all familar with: the introduction script. 

#### 

#### The Introduction Script

All cultures have some sort of introduction script. That is, a sequence of events that takes place when two people meet one another for the first time. This varies from culture to culture, but let's look at a common U.S. introduction script. We'll number the "steps" people follow when enacting the script. Then, we'll find those steps in an example exchange. 

1. Saluations \("Hello"\)
2. Sharing of names \("Hi, I am Botty McBotterson" "I'm Robot Bot III"\) 
3. Positive acknowledgement that this is the first meeting \("It's very nice to meet you"\) 
4. Both persons \(usually\) shake hands 

Imagine how off-putting it would be to be introduced to someone for the first time, and they skipped step three, even though you hadn't. You present your hand for the handshake and they simply look your hand and smile. Would that give you good feelings or bad feelings? Violating expectations of social script, at least brings attention to the interaction, potentially overriding the important info \(like peoples' names\). Thus, scripts become incredibly important to us as bot makers as we want to build scripts into our bots, which, at the bare minimum, allow us to operate within the sequences of communication that are "natural" for us. We want our users' expectations to be met. \(Although, in some cases we want to strategically disrupt their expectations too.\) 

How do we get there? We'll, through thoughtful trial and error! 

We'll be making our own bots--which play off of common messaging patterns--in order to wager a political critique, make a compelling joke, or to effectively teach people something on social media. 

## Monologic and Dialogic Scripts

The options we'll be working with this week allow for the creation of Twitter bots, or a Facebook Messenger bots. In particular we will be designing "one to many" messages, meaning they are more _monologic_ that they are _dialogic_. 

### \*\*\*\*

### **Monologic Scripts**

The root words of monologic are _monos_, which comes from the Greek for "alone," and _logos_, "word" \(or "speech"\). To engage a monologue, then, is to speak alone. Giving a speech to a large audience, for example, is a monologue--one person speaks, many others listen. In communication studies this is a one-to-many model of communication, relevant to television, radio, podcasts, Youtube videos, and many other media channels. 

Technically speaking, we live amid the many-to-many paradigm, wherein many people communicate to many others on the internet. But, for all intents and purposes, we'll be making one-to-many messages this week. Our one bot makes a message and many others listen.

#### Monologue as a Type of Communication

Just like any other realm of communication one-to-many communication has scripts that we \(the writers of such communications\) have to bear in mind, as our audiences will have expectations not only about _what_ we are saying, but _how_ we are saying it. 

Check out _American Rhetoric_ for examples of good speeches. These can be hugely generative for you to think about the kinds of scripts that we often expect in one-to-many communication.

#### **Some Examples of Monologic Bots**

Making monologic bot strategies is a lot like being a speech writer, only your messages are often made in short bursts which build on one another to engage make political statements, share useful information, or to give people compelling artistic experiences. Check out some examples in this article.

### **Dialogic Scripts**

Though we can be moved by powerful, well-crafted monologic communication, another communication context involves not the transmission of a single message to many, but rather the _exchange_ of messages between one and another. 

Dialogic--like monologic--also has Greek roots in the prefix _dia_, "across," and _logos_, "word" \(or "speech"\)--"words across." The distinct difference between monologic and dialogic scripts is that where monologic scripts are involved in contexts where _response_ is not expected, dialogic scripts are based in navigating expectations of response. 

Some bots are good public speakers, others are good conversationalists; both require effective consideration of social scripts in order to be successful. 



#### Dialogue as a Type of Communication 

Dialogue--a fancy way to say conversation--is something that has been studied for a long time \(at least 2500 years in the Western tradition\). One commone theme to be found from the numerous treatises, magazine articles, and self-help workshops that center on the art of dialogue is _listening_. If one does not listen to what the other says, they are not actually engaging dialogue at all, it is simply just two people engaging in monologue with each other. 

The defining characteristic of dialogic bot strategies is that they _adapt_ to users' input, while following social scripts appropriate to conversational exchange.

#### Some Examples of Dialogic Bots

Making dialogic bot strategy requires thinking about the exchanges and responses between bot and user that will be fun, or enlightening, or persuasive. Check out some examples here.
