# Assignment: Social Media Bot

## Social Media Bot 

Building from work you've already completed in your social media bot concept/image assignment you will create a \(machinic\) social media bot that employs a monologic communication strategy. Using one of two [tools](twitterbot.md#tools-tutorials), you will create either a Facebook Messenger bot or a Twitter bot that thoughtfully and creatively forwards a persausive, expository, or artistic message. Then, in a Gitbook document, you'll share your bot, alongside a description of the bot's purpose, how you built the bot, and a brief discussion of the kinds of social scripts relevant to your bot's communication. 

### 

### Assignment Objectives

1. To begin to apply the terms of use regarding automated communicaiton on a specific platform. 
2. To practice thinking about social machinic bot strategies. 
3. To start to become familiar with tools of bot-making. 
4. To plan an implement a communication strategy aware of the social scripts pertinent to a given context of communication. 
5. To create our own technical documents. 

### 

### Instructions

1. Read through the [tutorial](twitterbot.md#tools-tutorials) for your chosen platform. 
2. Using the "thow away" social media account, start making your bot.  
3. As you make your bot, keep notes. Make direct reference to your social media bot concept/image assignment and discuss the following. 
   1. What is your bot called? 
   2. What kind of bot is it?   
   3. What is the purpose of the bot? 
   4. What kinds of messages will the bot make? 
   5. What social script\(s\) do you think are relevant to the bot? 
   6. How will you build the bot to make the messages you want? \(Are there external resources/tools that you plan to use? Will you write the bot's messages directly into the script, or will you use other people's word lists, for instance? \) 
4. Using your chosen [tool](twitterbot.md#tools-tutorials), work on your bot until it is able to create messages on its own that are intelligible, and that represent the kind of messaging you planned for it to make. 
5. Go to the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) book you made for your previous assignments. 
   1. Make a page within that book that is descriptively titled and communicates the following information to the reader. _\(**Find an** **example of what your document might look like**_ [_**here**_](../../../assignment-examples/assignment-examples/example-social-media-bot.md)_.\)_

      2. Your bot name. 
      3. Your bot description. 
      4. A rationale for its existence \(does it add to art, help us think about politics?\). 
      5. An overview of the tool\(s\) you used, and your process for getting the bot to make the messages you wanted. 
      6. The script of your bot \(either as text pasted onto the page, or as a [screen shot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org) that captures the message map\).  
6. Submit the GitBook link for your book to the assignment window on Canvas. 
7. Also submit your GitBook link to the Slack channel.
