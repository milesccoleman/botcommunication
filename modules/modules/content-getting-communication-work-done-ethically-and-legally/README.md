# Week 2: Platforms, Ethics, Legality

## The Ethics and Legality of Bot Platforms

As we learned in our first week, bots are neat and fun and helpful. But bots can also be offensive and/or annoying and/or harmful on an equally relentless, mass scale. Consequently, when making bots, it is important to think about whether or not our bots are doing _good._ 

The way we will practice thinking about our bots as doing good or not will be with a specific focus on the _platform_ as the locus of ethical consideration. 

On our way to discussing a few platforms of bots, we will start first with a quick distinction between _ethics,_  _law,_ and _terms_ _of use._

### The Legal, the Ethical, and Terms of Use 

In most peoples' minds to break the law is to be unethical, and to follow the law is to be ethical. This is true much of the time. Going 50 miles per hour in a school zone marked at 25 miles per hour is illegal, and wrong, considering the act puts children at increased risk. 

However, there is a difference between doing wrong and doing illegally, which matters, especially with regard to emerging technology that we haven't yet "figured out" legally. Sometimes people make bots that spew hateful, incediary, or misleading information to which they are able to say: "I'm not doing anything illegal." And other times, companies create terms of use that are not doing good by the user, but nonetheless place legal requirements on them.

**Ethics** is an area of practice and study \(moral philosophy\) whereien the central goal is to articulate and understand the values of right and wrong. 

When we say that something is ethical, we mean that thing can withstand analytical scrutiny regarding the _virtues_ one does \(or does not\) demonstrate, whether or not _duty_ has been upheld, or whether or not _utility_ has been created. 

_Though they are often used synonymously, morals and ethics are different. **Morals** are the specific values that undergird a particular person's \(or society's\) outlook on right and wrong. Ethics helps us think carefully about our morals, in other words._ 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
 **Law** is an area of practice that involves the articulation, prescription, and enforcement of rules that bind a particular community. 

When we say that something is lawful, we mean that thing falls within the bounds of the rules, as they are currently written for the particular community in which they are meant to govern.

_Law is constantly evolving alongside the trajectories of societal norms and values. Sometimes this is manifest in leaving laws "on the books" but not enforcing them; other times, it is manifest in enforcement, which applies older laws in newer contexts. The law is meant as stable system of expectations concerning how it is that we conduct ourselves as members of a shared society._ 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Terms of use** are legally binding contracts that outline rules for the use of a given service or application. 

Terms of use can be violated by a user, which is enforced usually by the termination of service. But, terms of use can also be violated by a service provider, allowing opportunity for a user to file a lawsuit. 

_Terms of use, while legally binding, and often written in ways that are mindful of what is legal or illegal, are written by specific organizations. Terms of use can protect users. In many cases, however, the priority of the terms of use is the organization._ 
{% endhint %}

Because the law doesn't always capture what is wrong to do in emerging technology fields, we'll be striving also for ethical uses of bots. That is to say, as explore and expand the limits of automated communication--something we should be doing--it is always with an eye for what kind of character we are demonstrating as bot makers, what kinds of acts our bots are engageing, and what kinds of consequences come from those actions. 



## Doing Good with Bots

Did you know that as of July 1st, 2019 a [law](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2018/10/05/will-californias-new-bot-law-be-more-than-just-a-statement/?slreturn=20180918141419) will take effect that makes it illegal to attempt to make a sale or a statement about politics in California with a bot that is "undeclared" \(does not tell people it is a bot\)? 

Increasingly the law is catching up to our emerging technology, which largely is a good thing. But, for us, bot makers, this also means that we need to think about where and how we are making automated communication experiences and whether or not those experiences are lawful. But how do we do that if the law is still evolving to catch up to the medium? See the article included here.

A good rule of thumb is to avoid any bot designs that would reasonably: 

1. Represent a character that you would not be proud of \(e.g., hurtful language, manipulation\). 
2. Fail to uphold your duty to other people \(e.g., harassment, lying\). 
3. Demean utility for others \(e.g., mass producing "followers" on social media, confusing public discussion\). 

Beyond considering the broader ethical nature of our bot designs, there are also platform-specific rules to be aware of. 



### **Specific Platforms and their Terms of Use** 

Each bot platform has its own norms and expectations articulated in its terms of use \(and in broader acceptable practice on that medium\). So**,** we also need to think about whether or not our particuar bot design is appropriate for the platform we're using. The pimary platforms that we'll be making bots on are listed below. 



**Slack**

There are many bot platforms. This is but just a small list of those. No matter what your bot is, no matter the content, or the purpose, you should _always read the specific terms of use of the platform you plan to use_. And, you should do this often as terms of use are updated constantly, and the rules change over time. 

### 

## **This Week's Reading and Assignments**

#### **Reading**

**Chapter 3 and 4 of** [_**Designing Bots**_](file:///autocomm/~/edit/drafts/-LO_Kxqem2Og_1VNlU53/syllabus/syllabus-1/course-text)**.** Think about the specific platform that you would like to use to make a social bot eventually. 

\*\*\*\*

#### **Assignments**

When you are done with the readings for the week, choose a platform from the options covered \(i.e., Slack, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook Messenger,  Alexa, or Kik\). Study the terms of use for that specific platform and then write a [**Platform Analysis**](platform-analysis.md) that teaches the reader what the rules are for making bots on that platform.
