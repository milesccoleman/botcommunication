# Assignment: Platform Analysis

## Platform Analysis

All platforms have a terms of use. And, each of them is unique. Terms of use are not easy to read, nor are they always clear. This week we'll practice traversing and comprehending the rules that are important to us as bot makers by choosing a platform, locating the terms of use for that platform, and then identifying and analyzing the relevant rules in an easy to understand report. 

### 

### Assignment Objectives

1. To learn the terms of use regarding automated communicaiton on a specific platform. 
2. To practice comprehension of technical documents. 
3. To create our own technical documents. 

### 

### Instructions

1. Choose one of the platforms \(i.e., Slack, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook Messenger,  Alexa, or Kik\) discussed in the reading. _\(Note: Instagram's terms of use do not allow much room for automation, and so, will be off-limits as a final project option.\)_ 
2. Study the terms of use for your chosen platform. 
   1. What are the specific rules that matter to bot makers? 
   2. What are the specific wordings of those rules? Copy them directly into a document so you can share them later. 
   3. What the  rules mean? 
   4. Put into your own words a list of "rules of thumb" for bot makers who want to use your chosen platform. Things they should be aware of? Things they should, or shouldn't, do? 
3. Create a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) account. 
4. Make a book on GitBook that is descriptively titled with regard to this course. 
5. Then, make a specific page within that book that is descriptively titled, and communicates the following information to the reader. _\(Find instructions on how to get started using GitBook_ [_here_](https://docs.gitbook.com/getting-started)_. Also, **find an example of what your document might look like**_ [_**here**_](../../../assignment-examples/assignment-examples/platform-analysis-example.md)_.\)_
   1. The Rules on Bots Quoted Directly from the Terms of Use. 
   2. What the Rules Mean. 
   3. Rules of Thumb for Making _Platform Name_ Bots.
