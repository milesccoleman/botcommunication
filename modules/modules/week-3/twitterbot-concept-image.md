# Assignment: Social Machinic Bot Concept/Image

## Social Machinic Bot Concept/Image 

Using what you learned from your platform analysis, you will start doing preliminary design work for a social machinic bot. In a Gitbook document, you'll describe your concept, set up your social media account, decide on what tools you'll use to build your bot, and create a profile image. 

### 

### Assignment Objectives

1. To begin to apply the terms of use regarding automated communicaiton on a specific platform. 
2. To practice thinking about social machinic bot strategies. 
3. To start to become familiar with tools of bot-making. 
4. To create our own technical documents. 

### 

### Instructions

1. Choose one of the platforms \(i.e., Slack, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook Messenger,  Alexa, or Kik\) discussed in the reading. _\(Note: An Instagram bot, because their terms of use do not allow much room for automation will be off-limits.\)_ 
2. While making specific reference to the platform analysis you've written previously discuss the following. 
   1. What is your idea for a bot?  
   2. What platform will your bot "live" on? 
   3. What tools will you use to creat your bot? \(Find a list of tools [here](../../../resources/resources/tools.md).\) 
   4. Using tools like [LogoMaker](https://logomakr.com), [Canva](https://www.canva.com), and/or [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com), create a logo image for your bot. Be sure that imagery you use is explicitly free to use, or is your own. \([DeepDream](https://deepdreamgenerator.com) Generator is a fun way to have a machine help you make art.\) 
3. Make a "throw away" social media account for your chosen bot platform. 
   1. Give your bot a name that is catchy but also helps the user understand that it is a bot. 
   2. Add a description of your bot concept to the profile page. 
   3. Add your image to the profile page. 
   4. Copy the URL to your bot's social media profile page. 
4. Go to the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) book you made for your platform analysis. 
   1. Make a page within that book that is descriptively titled and communicates the following information to the reader. _\(Find instructions on how to get started using GitBook_ [_here_](https://docs.gitbook.com/getting-started)_. Also, find an example of what your document might look like_ [_here_](../../../assignment-examples/assignment-examples/social-machinic-bot-concept-image.md)_.\)_
      1. Your bot name. 
      2. Your bot description. 
      3. A rationale for its existence \(does it add to art, help us think about politics?\). 
      4. An overview of the tool you plan to use, and how you plan to use it to make your bot. 
      5. A brief statement about how you will be designing the bot in a way that respects the terms of use of your platform. 
      6. The URL to your bot's new profile page. 
5. Submit the GitBook link for your book to the assignment window on Canvas. 
6. Also submit your GitBook link to the Slack channel. 
7. Comment on one other persons GitBook document.
