## Social Machines

Usually when we're talking about something being _social_, it involves the coordination and communication between people and/or animals and/or insects and/or plants. My dog wags her tail to let me know she's happy. Blossums open to indicate that their nectar is avialable for bumble bees to consume. People smile at one another and share compliments to indicate that they appreciate others. 

Inanimate matter--like a rock--on the other hand, even if you were to talk to one, wouldn't necesarily be a social being, it is just a _thing_ that you are treating socially. As such, prevailing wisdome tells us that non-living matter can be regarded socially, but, it most emphatically is _not social_. 

But what about bots? They are made up of silicon processors firing off software. There is no way we might think of them as social beings, right? As it turns out, some bots are effective because they are able to trick us into thinking that they are social beings, wielding the gravitas of a fellow person. We will define these below as _social bots_. Conversely, there are also bots that are effective precisely because they are _machines._ We will defined these as _machinic bots_.

### Social Bots

In 1950, Alan Turing a famous character in the history of computing and the philosophy of conciousness came up with a test for assessing whether or not a machine had successfully reached the level of intelligence of a person. 



#### The \(Social\) Turing Test 

Unsurprisingly, the Turing Test \(as it later came to be called\) relied on communication. To perform the test it requires that real human being \(we'll call them Being C\) sits behind a wall with only a computer terminal connecting them to two other individuals: Being A and Being B. One of those beings is a fellow person, and the other is a computer.

If, after conversing with Being A and Being B, the person \(Being C\) cannot destinguish between the computer and their fellow person, one could say that the computer is sufficiently demonstrating intelligence. \(As to whether or not it _actually_ possesses intelligence is another matter, and one that Turing very wisely instructs us to avoid getting wrapped up in.\) 

While we are not necessarily interested in "spoofing" intelligence, we _are_ interested in another outcome achieved by passing the Turing test: the achievement of the status of social being for the computer. 

If the person cannot distinguish between the two entities, the options they are left with are to either 1\) treat both entities as inanimate _things_, or 2\) treat both entities as _social_ beings. Since option 1 runs the risk of treating a real person like a machine \(disrespecting that person, in other words\) we are more likely to choose option 2. 



#### The Problem of Social Machines

The problem with a machine that can pass the Turing test and successfully mimic another person is that, for better or worse, we humans appreciate when more than one person believes something. We give gravity to what our fellow social beings conclude to be true about the world.

If four people can encourage a person to question themselves \(even when they have a perfectly good conclusion to begin with\) then we should be alarmed to learn that on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook it is relatively easy for a single person to command 100s or even 1000s of machines that can masquerade as social beings.

#### Bot or Not?

$ give me super-powers

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
