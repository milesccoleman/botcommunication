# Example: Social Media Bot

\*\*\*\*

## **Bot Name**

DTaC BOT

### \*\*\*\*

## **Bot Description**

Just a bot who loves philosophy and digital technology. 

### \*\*\*\*

## **Rationale** 

Many people tend to think about technology as somethign that is "above" philosophical critique. My bot will take philosophers names and mix them with newer technologies in order to help people think about technology as an object of philosophical scrutinty and analysis. As a monologic bot, it will not require _responses_ to user input, but rather will be generating a constant flurry of messages to Twitter at large.

## **Overview of How I Made the Bot** 

I used [Cheap Bots, Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) to make my bot. I wanted it to share \(hopefully\) profound statements about digital technology and philosophy. To do that I wrote my own list of technology into the dictionary of the bot, designating it as "technology." 

First I came up with the basic kinds of message structures that I wanted the bot to make. To do this I wrote out my own sentences about philosohpers and technology, and then replaced important nouns and adjectives with items to be replaced by the bot software. 

#### 

### Example Starting Sentence

"Aristotle using cantankerous Python code with rhetoric is surprisingly cool",

I then put the starting sentence into correct JSON format, and replaced the key nouns and ajectives with \#'d items to be replaced later by the bot. 

#### 

### Example of Starting Sentence in JSON 

```text
"#name# using #descriptions# #technology# with #idea# is #descriptions#", 
```

I did this four times, using the [visual editor](http://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/) that Cheap Bots Done Quick provides.

#### 

### Putting the Sentence Structures into Bot's Code

The visual editor was able to put all of my sentences into JSON under the item "origin." 

```text
	"origin": [
		"#name# using #descriptions# #technology# with #idea# is #descriptions#", 
        "#idea# is #descriptions# when you consider #name#'s thoughts on how #descriptions# #technology# can be", 
		"#technology# is #descriptions# when you're using it with #name#", 
		"Imagine how useful #technology# would be for being a #occupation#. #name# might even say such a use would be #descriptions#!"
	],
```

With my basic setence structures in place, I had to populate lists of words for four different items: 

* technology
* name
* idea
* descriptions
* occupation

I populated the lists myself by typing them in under their respective item names. I'll share the JSON for each. 



### List of "technology" 

To give the bot something to talk about I made a list of technologies, nested under the item name: "technology."

```text
"technology": [
		"VR ",
		"a smart phone",
		"an xBox",
		"a Facebook Group",
		"Web Annotator", 
		"Youtube", 
		"Netflix", 
		"a laptop",
		"Python code", 
		"HoloLens"
	],
```

#### 

### List of "name"

Then I made my own list of philosophers, under the item "name." 

```text
"name": [
		"Michel Foucault",
		"John Dewey",
		"Aristotle",
		"Plato",
		"Walter Benjamin",
		"Jurgen Habermas", 
		"Francis Bacon", 
		"Stuart Hall", 
		"Langdon Winner", 
		"Bruno Latour"
	],
```



### List of "idea"

To add some more complexity, I wanted to add specific ideas, as it would give the philosophers an object for thought. I listed these under the item "idea." 

```text
	"idea": [
		"rhetoric",
		"semiotics",
		"human centered design",
		"technical communication",
		"phenomenology", 
		"pragmatics", 
		"virtue ethics", 
		"hashtag activism"
	],
```



### **List of "descriptions"** 

Now that I had the basic workings of intelligible sentences, I wanted to add some "spice," and in particular a list that was longer so it would add more variance to the things the bot says. After a quick Google search I was able to find a pre-formatted list of [adjectives](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/words/adjs.json). I copied the list from that resource and pasted into my code under the item "descriptions." The list is really long, so I'll just include the first ten items as an example. 

```text
{
  "descriptions":
    [ "Aristotelian",
      "Arthurian",
      "Bohemian",
      "Brethren",
      "Mosaic",
      "Oceanic",
      "Proctor",
      "Terran",
      "Tudor",
      "abroad",
  ], 
```



### List of "occupation"

While I was seraching the web for pre-formated JSON lists of words, I found a list of [occupations](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/humans/occupations.json). Like the "descriptions" list, it is really long, so I'll just include a bit of it as an example. 

```text
"occupation": [
		"accountant",
		"actor",
		"actuary",
		"adhesive bonding machine tender",
		"adjudicator",
		"administrative assistant",
		"administrative services manager",
		"adult education teacher",
		"advertising manager",
		"advertising sales agent",
],
```



## **The Complete Code of the Bot**

Because I actually ended up with about 1300 lines of code, I thought it would be a good idea to include the completed code last, so the reader doesn't have to scroll for the rest of their life to see the code in its entirety. At any rate, here it is. 

```text
{
	"origin": [
		"#name# using #descriptions# #technology# with #idea# is #descriptions#", 
        "#idea# is #descriptions# when you consider #name#'s thoughts on how #descriptions# #technology# can be",
