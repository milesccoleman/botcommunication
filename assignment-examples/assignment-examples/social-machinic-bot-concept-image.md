## **My Idea for a Social Media Bot**

### **Bot Name**

DTaC BOT

### **Bot Description**

Just a bot who loves philosophy and digital technology. 

### **Rationale** 

Many people tend to think about technology as somethign that is "above" philosophical critique. My bot will take philosophers names and mix them with newer technologies in order to help people think about technology as an object of philosophical scrutinty and analysis. 

### **Tools** 

I will use [Cheap Bots, Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) to make my bot. To do so I will be writing lists of technology into the dictionary of the bot as well as lists of philosophers. I've located both a list of [philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_philosophers) and a list of digital [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies). I plan to write these into the software in order to populate the contents of the bot. After a quick search for "JSON list of adjectives," I've also located a preformatted list of [adjectives](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/words/adjs.json) that I will mix in with my pre-written sentences on the bot \(this will add variety of expression to them\). 

### **Platform Considerations**

I am using Twitter as the platform for the bot. As we learned last week in my [platform analysis](file:///autocomm/~/edit/drafts/-LPlmwnwiuy5dUuPsAvj/modules/modules/week-2/platform-analysis), Twitter does not allow my bot to send any outgoing messages to other people. So, I will design my bot in such a way as to only "Tweet" to its own profile. I will also be designing in a few responses for when people Tweet directly at the bot. Basically, my bot will only "bother" people, if they engage the Twitter profile of DTaC Bot. 

### **Mâ€‹y Bot's Profile Page**

Note: The example profile includeed here already has a bot creating messages. For this assignment, it is perfectly fine to turn in a profile that does not yet have any messages generated.
